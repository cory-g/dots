### Notes
- I'm not responsible for you messing stuff up by using my dotfiles. Not that anything will get messed up but you never know.
- `~/.local/bin` needs to be added to `$PATH`. I do this in my `~/.path` file which is sourced by `~/.xinitrc`.
- install figlet fonts from [xero on github](https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts) to `/usr/share/figlet`.
- My main text editor is `sublime-text-3` most of the configuration can be found in the [sublime-text directory](https://github.com/cory-g/dots/tree/master/sublime-text/.config/sublime-text-3)
