# Arch .dotfiles

![Screenshot](scrot.png)

> This repo contains a little more than my dotfiles. Within are many of my settings, scripts, templates, structures, and opinions that will likely be useful to very few except myself. There is probably quite a bit amiss about this setup but it works for me.

### Basics
- OS: Arch Linux 
- Shell: fish 
- WM: i3 
- Theme: SolArc-Dark [GTK2/3] 
- Icons: Numix [GTK2/3] 
- Terminal: dotz 

#### Notes

- `~/.local/bin` needs to be added to `$PATH`
- install figlet fonts from [xero on github](https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts)

#### Packages
A complete list of packages installed by me onto my system is located [here](https://github.com/cory-g/dots/tree/master/docs/Packages.md).
