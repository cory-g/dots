### Notes
- I'm not responsible for you messing stuff up by using my dotfiles. Not that anything will get messed up but you never know.
- `~/.local/bin` needs to be added to `$PATH`. I do this in my `~/.path` file which is sourced by `~/.xinitrc`.
- install figlet fonts from [xero on github](https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts) to `/usr/share/figlet`.
